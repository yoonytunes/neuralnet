# Neural Network in C++

This project aims to provide flexibility for the user to configure all I/O, layers, activation, and overall architecture of dense (fully-connected) models best suited for their particular needs. The advantages of this, apart from its cutomizable nature, is that it provides high-level abstraction for its users. Never mind the complex works under the hood; the user just has to build the network and feed the necessary data to it.
